This repository has a bunch of C programs.
I have tried to indicate what the program does in the file name, but if it's still not clear, you can always open it up and you will see a brief description of the program as a comment.

You can download the program you need and compile it using a C compiler like GCC, or you can simply copy the program and paste it in your IDE.
